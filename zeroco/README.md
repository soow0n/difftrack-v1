<strong>ZeroCo</strong> is a zero-shot correspondence model that demonstrates the effectiveness of cross-attention maps, learned through cross-view completion training, in capturing correspondences.
</div>

## 🔍  Overview
In this work, we explore a novel perspective on cross-view completion learning by drawing an analogy to self-supervised correspondence learning. Through our analysis, we show that cross-attention maps in cross-view completion capture correspondences more effectively than correlations derived from encoder or decoder features.

This repository introduces <strong>ZeroCo</strong>, a zero-shot correspondence model designed to demonstrate that cross-attention maps encode rich correspondences. Additionally, we provide <strong>ZeroCo-Flow</strong> and <strong>ZeroCo-Depth</strong>, which extend ZeroCo for learning-based matching and multi-frame depth estimation, respectively.

## 🛠️ What to expect

- [x] Release Zeroco code   
- [ ] Release Zeroco-flow and Zeroco-depth code
- [ ] Release pretrained weights


## Environment

* Create and activate conda environment with python 3.10.


  ```bash
  conda create -n ZeroCo python=3.10.15
  conda activate ZeroCo
  ```

* Our code is developed based on pytorch 2.1.2 and CUDA 12.1. Please refer to the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file to install the necessary dependencies.

  ```
  pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Create admin/local by running the following command and update the paths to the dataset

  ```
  python -c "from admin.environment import create_default_local_file; create_default_local_file()"
  ```

## Evaluation Datasets
- For the evaluation of the zero-shot correspondence task, we used the HPatches and ETH3D datasets.
- You can proceed with the download and preprocessing using the following bash script.

  ```bash
  bash download_ETH3D.sh
  bash download_hpatches.sh
  ```

## Prepare Pretrained Weights
- Since we evaluate using a pretrained model for Cross-view Completion, it is necessary to download the pretrained weights.
- The models currently implemented in our code are as follows. Please visit each repository to obtain the pretrained weights and download them into the [./pretrained_weights](./pretrained_weights/) folder.
  - [CroCo](https://github.com/naver/croco): Cross-view completion pretrained model (Our baseline).
  - [DUSt3R](https://github.com/naver/dust3r): 3D pointmap regressor model based on CroCo.
  - [MASt3R](https://github.com/naver/mast3r): Feature matching model based on CroCo and DUSt3R. 

- Additionally, you can directly evaluate models with the same architecture as DUSt3R, such as [MonST3R](https://github.com/Junyi42/monst3r).




## Zero-shot Evaluation
The `scripts` folder contains multiple bash files for evaluating models on either the HPatches or ETH3D datasets. Most experiments were conducted on HPatches. For each model, you can perform zero-shot evaluation of geometric matching performance using one of three methods:

### Available Methods
1. **Encoder Correlation**: Uses encoder features to build a correlation
2. **Decoder Correlation**: Uses decoder features to build a correlation
3. **Cross-Attention Maps**: Uses cross-attention maps for correlation

For detailed explanations of each method, please refer to our paper.

### Example Commands

```bash
# HPatches (Original Resolution) - CroCov2
bash scripts/run_hp_crocov2_Largebase.sh

# HPatches (240 Resolution) - CroCov2
bash scripts/run_hp240_crocov2_LargeBase.sh

# ETH3D - CroCov2 
bash scripts/run_eth3d_crocov2_LargeBase.sh
```

<summary> Script Configuration Details </summary>
Each evaluation script contains several key parameters that can be customized:

```bash
# Example evaluation script
CUDA=0  # Specify GPU device rank
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${CUDA} python -u eval_matching.py \
    --seed 2024                     # Random Seed Selection
    --dataset hp                    # Dataset (hp: HPatches, hp-240: HPatches (240x240), eth3d: ETH3D)
    --model_img_size 224 224        # CVC model's Input image dimensions
    --model crocov2                 # Model type [crocov1, crocov2, dust3r, mast3r]
    --pre_trained_models croco      # Pre-trained model type
    --croco_ckpt /path/to/croco/ckpts/CroCo_V2_ViTLarge_BaseDecoder.pth
    --output_mode ca_map            # Correlation method choose from [enc_feat, dec_feat, ca_map]
    --output_ca_map                 # Enable cross-attention map output
    --reciprocity                   # Enable reciprocal cross-attention map
    --save_dir /path/to/save/images/for/visualisation/  
```
